[Assignment Summary]
I was struggling with idea of having the php within the html initially. The challenge was
switching back and forth between html and php, and knowing how to correctly output from the
php. I also found myself frequently forgetting to put semicolons in, making my script not run
correctly. The concatenation of the input history was working correctly at one point, then I
changed something, and it quit working. The debugging is where most of the hours into this
project came from. Turns out spaces before and after my comma were messing with concatenation.

*UPDATE*
I modified the function that checks the guess to also call the add guess history. By doing this
I can add whether the guess was high or low to the guess history.
