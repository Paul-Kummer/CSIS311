[Stage 1 Summary]
This was fairly easy, and is somewhat related to the way I initially wanted to do assign02b.
However, assign02b required 5 different files, which I wanted to have all done in one php.
The biggest challenge was changing the wrong files in my editor and fixing them.

[Stage 2 Summary]
I've learned that debugging is very time consuming. There isn't anything telling me where the code
went wrong. Therefore, I end up changing some code that is working and breaking other parts. I learned
that I needed a relative path for my include, otherwise the functions would not work. Also, I found out
that using buttons on a form works best when trying to run code for PHP.

[Stage 3 Summary]
I was able to debug much more successfully after getting advice from the meeting with the instructor.
My ability to understand how the a persistent multidimensional array actually worked was tested.
I had to really focus on what was going on, and I think I could improve the readability and layout if
I decide to put more time into it.

[Stage 5 Summary]
This step was fairly easy, I just spent most of my time tweaking the css script to get
everything the way I wanted. There are still a few minor things I want changed, but they
are not important enought to warrent the additional time. Essentially, I learned more about 
the capabilities of CSS.
