[Assignment Summary]
I've learned that debugging is very time consuming. There isn't anything telling me where the code
went wrong. Therefore, I end up changing some code that is working and breaking other parts. I learned
that I needed a relative path for my include, otherwise the functions would not work. Also, I found out
that using buttons on a form works best when trying to run code for PHP.
