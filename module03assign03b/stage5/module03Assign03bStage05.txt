[Assignment Summary]
This step was fairly easy, I just spent most of my time tweaking the css script to get
everything the way I wanted. There are still a few minor things I want changed, but they
are not important enought to warrent the additional time. Essentially, I learned about 
more of the capabilities of CSS.
