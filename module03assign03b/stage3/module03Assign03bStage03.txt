[Assignment Summary]
I was able to debug much more successfully after getting advice from the meeting with the instructor.
My ability to understand how the a persistent multidimensional array actually worked was tested.
I had to really focus on what was going on, and I think I could improve the readability and layout if
I decide to put more time into it.
