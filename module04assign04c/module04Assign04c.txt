[Assignment Summary]
This assignment allowed me to learn how to make php interact with mysql in a predictable
way. I spent a lot of time tweaking the forms and layout to get it just the way I wanted.
I really enjoyed making a second css file for a dark mode; It's a lot easier on the eyes.
I had to review the persistent data with sessions, as I was getting some information lost.
If I had to do this assignment over again, I may change the way data is handled and maybe
make new pages for each form, but I'm not sure. The large switch statements seem a little
bit too much as well. Overall, I enjoyed this assigment, which is why I spent so much time on it 
looking up how to do things and make things work the way I wanted, which wasn't required for
the assignment.

Additionaly, I learned more about mySQL, and how to make stored procedures, which is very
similar to sql server. I ended up installing mysql workbench and connecting to puff to
interact with the database. This allowed me to work with the table more fluidly than using
a command line on putty and gave me better visuals of what I was working on. It also, allows
the changing of table information really easily with auto generated scripts.


*bugs, I do not check the input for valid input. This leaves it open to sql
	injection, but since I'm already allowing sql entries, it don't see it
	being a big issue.
