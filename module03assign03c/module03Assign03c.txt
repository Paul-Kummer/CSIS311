[Assignment Summary]
I learned that sessions make the code a lot easier to understand. You don't need
to try to keep track of whether a variable is current or a recently submitted value.
It just made everything make a lot more sense. I think if I was to spend more time on
this assignment, I would make vars to hold session vars, so There wasn't $_SESSION 
everywhere in the code. Then I would make a function to place everything into the 
super global session vars. All things considered, it was pretty simple to convert my
old script with sessions instead.
