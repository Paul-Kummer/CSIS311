[Assignment Summary]
I learned to use basic file manipulation in php. The real challenge was making
all the variables work in correspondence with sessions. I had to go back and 
review how sessions worked. I also had to use a private browser session, otherwise
data from the previous session was stored. There were some variables showing up that
i had deleted with a newer version of the code.
