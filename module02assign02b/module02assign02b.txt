[Assignment Summary]
This assignment was helpful for me to better understand how PHP and HTML can work together.
I was able to see how the $_REQUEST was able to take an associatively linked item from an
array and assign them to a variable, which can be used to make conversions. I also discovered
the usefulness of videos from Lydia.com. They had a walkthrough of the unit conversion I was
working on. They did it in a slightly different way. They used just a PHP file instead of using
HTML that called a PHP file to do processing. I think I would prefer to do it the way they did,
but overall it helped make me more familiar with using PHP and HTML individually and making the
two work together.

In the process of going through this assignment, I went back to many of the previous videos and
refreshed myself on how to correctly use the syntaxes of PHP and HTML.
