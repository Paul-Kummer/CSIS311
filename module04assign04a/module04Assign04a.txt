[Assignment Summary]
This assignment was a bunch of review for me mostly since I took the databases class
a few semesters ago. It was a good review, especially since I mostly worked with SQL Server
instead of MySQL. Additionally, I had made a python program that interacted with a personal
MySQL database for a personal project, so I had some additional experience with interacting
with databases programatically. I had some issues with the output of my tables being 
displayed correctly, but it appears all the data is in the database correctly, so I'm not 
sure what the problem is.
