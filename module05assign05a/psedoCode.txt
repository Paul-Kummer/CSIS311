I would like to choose Şeptică as my card game. The rules that I know may vary compared to other versions. However, 
I will be going off the rules as explained to me by my wife, who is from Romania. Traditionally, they would use a 
Bohemian deck of cards, but I will adjust it to use a standard card deck that most are familiar with in the U.S.

To start, a 32 card deck will be shuffled and 5 cards will be distributed to two players; One player will be the 
computer. Then the remaining main deck will go in the middle of the table and the top card will be flipped over and 
set aside on the playing deck. Then the first player will play a compatible card on top of the card on the playing 
deck, face up. If a player doesn't have a compatible playing card, they must draw a card from the top of the main deck. 
If there are no remaining cards on the main deck, all cards from the playing deck, except the current card in play can 
be reshuffled and transformed into the main deck. This process will continue until a player has no cards remaining, 
meaning they won the round.

The cards that are considered compatible with the current card on top of the playing deck are cards the match it's suit 
or value. However, there are three cards that have special abilities. The Ace will skip the next players turn unless they 
play an Ace as well. The Ace must be played on the same suit or another Ace. The Jack makes the next player take two 
cards from the main deck, unless they have a Jack to play themselves. If a player plays a Jack on top of another Jack, 
then the next player will have to take an additional 2 cards from the main deck and the current player will take none. 
This can be done up to a total of four times, which could result in a player taking 8 cards. Jacks must be played on a 
card of the same suit or on another Jack. The last special card is the 7, which allows the player to change the suit to 
any of the suits. They can play the 7, then declare the suit to be clubs, spades, diamonds, or hearts.
